## Description üìù
This undertaking employs an 8-puzzle resolution approach employing a "mountain ascent" enhancement technique.

The conundrum comprises a grid of dimensions N x N, alongside a solitary vacant space. The tiles possess the capability to shift into the empty space, facilitating the resolution of the puzzle via a series of maneuvers.

The resolver operates through:

1. Receiving an initial configuration of the puzzle from the user
2. Implementing heuristic enhancements to discover more favorable configurations
3. Iteratively modifying the puzzle in the direction of the target configuration
4. Presenting each transitional configuration to the user


## To-do üóíÔ∏è

-   8-Puzzle Problem Solver with Hill Climbing Algorithm
    -   This Python script offers a resolution for the 8-puzzle problem by employing the hill climbing algorithm with two distinct heuristics. It illustrates the journey to finding the solution through Pygame, providing a graphical representation.
